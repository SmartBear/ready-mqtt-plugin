## ReadyAPI MQTT Plugin

This plugin adds two new TestSteps to the functional testing in ReadyAPI - one for publishing messages to an MQTT broker and one for receiving (and asserting) messages. It integrates fully with all other ReadyAPI features like property expansion, property transfers, data-driven testing, etc.

Install the plugin via the Plugin Manager inside ReadyAPI.
